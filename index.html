									During undergraduate time at UW Bothell, I have been studying many useful courses,
									such as Cloud Computing, Computer Vision, System Analysis and Design, Data Structure 
									and  Algorithm, Operating System,Software Engineer, and Compiler, etc.
								</p>

								<p>
									I like to read tech news or do coding during my freetime. 
									I usually listening to  isntrumental music while programing to increase my thinking process.
									I do play game to relax, and one of my favorite game is Legend of Zelda Breadth of the Wild. 
								</p>

									<h3> Projects </h3>
									I have implemented some final projects while taking CS courses at UW Bothell.
									Besides projects that I have mentioned in the resume, I also implemented 
									other applications as my side projects such as, simpleATM, WeatherAPI, WebCrawls, 
									Voice_Speeech Recognition which you can find at <a href= "https://github.com/EricDang261"> GitHub </a>.																		
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I am currently working on the machine learning on Embeded sytem project with
									my classmate.
									The project is to acceletate the inference time of AlexNet model on Rassbery Pi and Jetson Nano
									via weight prunning model compression technique. Since it is on progress, I couldn't publish
									the report. Once it is done, you can find at this <a href=""> link </a>.
